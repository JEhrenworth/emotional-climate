Are there any other ways you want to feel when you're at school? (Not required)

Happy



Relaxed
Like I'm home, surrounded by family!




Engaged
happy


Understood.


I just want to feel like I'm not surrounded by people who are out to get me.





Valued, Understood, Celebrated

at peaceful
No
Independant, versatile, free
I want to feel calm and understood.
Just overall happy. But most of the time at Avenues that isn't true.
Anything but depressed and anxious
Hopeful







productive







the liberation of not having to be in hip



like I can talk to anyone
Successful

A lot of the times I feel disrespected by other specific students at school, but I also feel confident and connected to others.



Comfortable, happy, organized


A unwarranted feeling of duty to take in as much as I can, both academically and socially.



Motivated

not bored out of my mind
Politically respected. Anything non liberal is hated at Avenues.
